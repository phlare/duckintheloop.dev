<p data-start="494" data-end="727">I’m a software engineer with 30 years experience learning how to use AI as a planning and coding companion. I do not envision AI as a replacement, not as an authority, and not as a shortcut to understanding. Just as another thing in the loop while I think, design, debug, and occasionally get stuck.</p>
<p data-start="729" data-end="785">The metaphor I keep coming back to is the <em data-start="771" data-end="784">rubber duck</em>.</p>
<p data-start="787" data-end="1037">Developers have long used rubber duck debugging as a way to externalize thinking: you explain the problem out loud, step by step, and somewhere along the way the bug reveals itself. The duck doesn’t solve anything. It just forces clarity.</p>
<p data-start="1039" data-end="1094">Programming with the assistance of AI feels like a strange evolution of that idea.</p>
<p data-start="1096" data-end="1254">Sometimes it behaves like a very patient duck.<br data-start="1142" data-end="1145">Sometimes it behaves like a confident one that’s very wrong.<br data-start="1200" data-end="1203">Sometimes it introduces entirely new failure modes.</p>
<p data-start="1256" data-end="1439">What’s interesting to me isn’t whether the AI is “right,” but how it changes the <em data-start="1337" data-end="1359">shape of my thinking</em> when it’s present. What I explain. What I skip. What I trust. What I shouldn’t.</p>
<p data-start="1441" data-end="1494">This site is where I plan to jot down some musings as I experiment and tailor the tools that are out there to a workflow that's actually helpful and productive.</p>
<p data-start="1496" data-end="1566">I'm not writing tutorials, or best practices, or heralding lofty opinions.</p>
<p data-start="1568" data-end="1710">Just notes about things I tried, things that half-worked, things that didn’t, and ideas that will probably change over time. I may even change the <a href="https://duckintheloop.dev/posting-rules/">posting rules</a> down the line. </p>
<p data-start="1712" data-end="1802">If anything here turns out to be useful to someone else, great.<br data-start="1775" data-end="1778">If not, that’s fine too.</p>
<p data-start="1804" data-end="1879">For now, I’m just talking to the duck and paying attention to what happens. 🦆</p>
